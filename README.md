# RSPLSDeathmatch
Rock Scissor Paper Lizard Spock Deathmatch!

## Install and Run
Install must be done with a Windows OS, since we are using the specific Microsoft Packages for this project!

Run the project through a build host using Xamarins Build Host, either on a same computer or a build host.

### PS
Be sure to update the packages and set the startup project as the client side, namely iOS. Be sure to follow since we have a goal of finishing this app to be run for fun and to have as education material. If you want to contribute, feel free to make pull request and we will look it over!
